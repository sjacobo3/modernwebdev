# Pick My Professor

## About

**Pick My Professor** is a web platform designed to make college course planning easier and more transparent.  
While platforms like Reddit and Rate My Professor offer insights, they often lack structure or completeness.

**Problem:** Registering for classes can be overwhelming and one class can significantly impact a student’s academic journey. Reliable information on courses is often scattered or missing.

**Solution:** A centralized space where students can read and post course reviews, connect with other students via messaging, and (coming soon) build a personalized 4-year academic plan.

## Features

- ✏️ Logged-in users can **create, edit, and delete course reviews** by department and course number
- 📋 **Filter** reviews by department
- 🔒 One review per course per user
- 📩 Built-in **messaging feature** for users to connect with each other  
- 🔍 Plans for future development: **4-year academic planner** and rating insights
